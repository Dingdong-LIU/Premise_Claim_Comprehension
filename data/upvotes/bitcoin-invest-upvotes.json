This was a 500% increase and was fueled by purely speculative investments.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: italic; background: none;\">Fundamentals were thrown away. People were rushing to buy any internet based company, ignoring the fact that these companies wouldn’t be making any money for the next few years. Money was cheap. Funding was easy. A bubble was formed.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: italic; background: none;\">And like all bubbles, it burst in 2001. Companies that had a market capitalization of hundreds of millions were now worth 0. The stock market rapidly declined. Trillions of dollars of investors money was lost.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Flashback no. 2</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: italic; background: none;\">The housing bubble, 2006/2007</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: italic; background: none;\">After the recession the “.com” bubble caused, interest rates started to drop. Investors abandoned the stock market and turned to real estate. Lending requirements all but vanished. Housing prices started to go up. Speculators entered the market and made tens of thousands of dollars in weeks. A bubble was formed.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: italic; background: none;\">And like all bubbles, it burst in 2007/2008 with the collapse of Lehmann Brothers, causing the largest recession in history since World War II. Millions of dollars were lost. Homes were destroyed. It took the economy years to recover.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">What is the definition of a “bubble” in finance?</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">A “bubble” occurs when the price of a stock or investment is driven up to </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">unsustainably </span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">high levels, substantially way more than what that item is worth. This bubble is usually caused by emotions of the masses, and not by logical investing or “looking at fundamentals”.

The price of Bitcoin has jumped 18,749,900% since 2010. It made sense to invest in it a few years ago. It was secure, unregulated and cryptocurrency seems like the future. But does it make sense to invest in it now?</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Yes, Bitcoin has its pros. It’s unregulated. Decentralized. Operates on Blockchain technology. But it’s also unregulated(see what I did there?). Has no intrinsic value. </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">And it’s highly volatile.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Look, I might even be wrong. There are people that have forecasted the price of Bitcoin to hit 100,000$ a coin in ten years.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">But I’m going to stay out of it.

      "content": "Ahh Bitcoin. Buying one in 2010 at 0.08$ a coin would now make you 14000$ a coin for every coin that you bought. Which means if you invested 100$ into Bitcoins in 2010 they would be worth a whopping 17.5 million dollars today. Are bitcoins the future? Or are they going to crash and burn? Instead of telling you to invest in it or not, what I’m going to do is outline some facts about bitcoin as an investment and tell you about what happened with bubbles in the past. And then you can decide. Flashback no. 1 The Dot com bubble, 2000 Fueled by the rise of companies with a “.com” after their name, the “.com” bubble saw the price of the NASDAQ jump from 1000 to 5000 over 5 years. This was a 500% increase and was fueled by purely speculative investments. Fundamentals were thrown away. People were rushing to buy any internet based company, ignoring the fact that these companies wouldn’t be making any money for the next few years. Money was cheap. Funding was easy. A bubble was formed. And like all bubbles, it burst in 2001. Companies that had a market capitalization of hundreds of millions were now worth 0. The stock market rapidly declined. Trillions of dollars of investors money was lost. Flashback no. 2 The housing bubble, 2006/2007 After the recession the “.com” bubble caused, interest rates started to drop. Investors abandoned the stock market and turned to real estate. Lending requirements all but vanished. Housing prices started to go up. Speculators entered the market and made tens of thousands of dollars in weeks. A bubble was formed. And like all bubbles, it burst in 2007/2008 with the collapse of Lehmann Brothers, causing the largest recession in history since World War II. Millions of dollars were lost. Homes were destroyed. It took the economy years to recover. What is the definition of a “bubble” in finance? A “bubble” occurs when the price of a stock or investment is driven up to unsustainably high levels, substantially way more than what that item is worth. This bubble is usually caused by emotions of the masses, and not by logical investing or “looking at fundamentals”. And it always starts off as something that made sense in the beginning. Its exactly the same with Bitcoin. The price of Bitcoin has jumped 18,749,900% since 2010. It made sense to invest in it a few years ago. It was secure, unregulated and cryptocurrency seems like the future. But does it make sense to invest in it now? Yes, Bitcoin has its pros. It’s unregulated. Decentralized. Operates on Blockchain technology. But it’s also unregulated(see what I did there?). Has no intrinsic value. And it’s highly volatile. Look, I might even be wrong. There are people that have forecasted the price of Bitcoin to hit 100,000$ a coin in ten years. But I’m going to stay out of it. Warren Buffett has warned against it. Jamie Dimon has warned against it. Alan Greenspan compared it to gambling in Las Vegas. If you must invest in it, remember the golden rule of investing - Never invest more than what you’re willing to lose. If you absolutely must, no more than 10% of your portfolio must be invested in risky assets. Like the famous economist Paul Samuelson once said, “Investing should be like watching paint dry and watching grass grow. If you want excitement, take 100$ and go to Vegas”. EDIT: I seem to have gotten a lot of backlash for this answer. Guys, I understand were you all are coming from and I agree, 100%. Blockchain IS revolutionary.

This answer is ONLY about whether you should make an investment in Bitcoin or not. Blockchain is an exceedingly innovative and futuristic technology, no doubt about that. I’m going to end this with a quote from Benjamin Graham, widely regarded as one of the best Investors of our time. “Obvious prospects for physical growth in an industry do not translate into obvious prospects for investors”. EDIT 2: For all the haters in the comments: This answer was first drafted when Bitcoin was at 14,000 USD a coin. The price of Bitcoin is now 6758 USD a coin.

      "content": "Let’s start with what bitcoin is? Bitcoin is a digital currency created in January 2009 following the housing market crash. It follows the ideas set out in a whitepaper by the mysterious and pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto. The identity of the person or persons who created the technology is still a mystery. Bitcoin offers the promise of lower transaction fees than traditional online payment mechanisms and is operated by a decentralized authority, unlike government-issued currencies. There are no physical bitcoins, only balances kept on a public ledger that everyone has transparent access to, that – along with all Bitcoin transactions – is verified by a massive amount of computing power. Bitcoins are not issued or backed by any banks or governments, nor are individual bitcoins valuable as a commodity. Despite it not being legal tender, Bitcoin charts high on popularity, and has triggered the launch of hundreds of other virtual currencies collectively referred to as Ripple. Etc. Bitcoin is powered by a technology called a blockchain. To understand Bitcoin, you must understand a little bit about the technology in order to make a wise choice for your investment strategy. A blockchain is a public database that shows all transactions, with user privacy protected by “cryptography”. There are many types of blockchains, and many types of coins. Since Bitcoin was created, there have been hundreds of more coins brought to the market, many of which are cheaper, faster, and more efficient. For example, Litecoin processes at 56 transactions per second. Newer faster blockchains like EOS can process hundreds of thousands of transactions per second. In terms of utility, Bitcoin only processes 7 transactions per second. So you may be wondering, why is the price of Bitcoin so high? There are lots of reasons, such as the fact that it was the first coin, it has brand recognition, and you can use to buy services on some internet websites. But other coins like Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash are catching up. Why Invest in Bitcoin? It seems silly to some people that one bitcoin can be worth thousands of dollars. What makes bitcoins valuable? Bitcoins Are Scarce Let’s look to gold as an example currency. There is a limited amount of gold on earth. As new gold is mined, there is always less and less gold left and it becomes harder and more expensive to find and mine. For this reason, along with Gold’s millenia-long history as a medium of exchange, it has long been considered a hedge against monetary inflation. “Gold is a very under-owned asset, even though gold has become much more popular. If you ask any central bank, any sovereign wealth fund, any individual what percentage of their portfolio is in gold..., you'll find it to be a very small.... It's...imprudently small..., particularly at a time when we're losing a currency regime.” Ray Dalio, Legendary Hedge Fund Manager The same is true with Bitcoin. There will only be 21 million Bitcoins, and as time goes on, they become harder and harder to mine. Take a look at Bitcoin’s inflation rate and supply rate: and harder to mine.

Weeks later, you couldn’t sell your investment for more than $7,051. The bitcoin market is constantly changing. With such an unpredictable market, you can hardly get a good return on your investment. To avoid huge loss, keep a close eye on the market.Threat of online hacking. Hacking is a big threat facing a bitcoin investor. Bitcoin exchanges let you buy and sell your cryptos using a mobile app or website. This leaves them susceptible to hacking and theft of all your investment. And bitcoin held on exchanges isn’t insured by the FDIC.Little or no regulation. The bitcoin market currently operates with no major regulations. It isn’t taxed and governments have no clear stance on it. As a result, you could stand exposed to fraud and malpractice.Limited use. Bitcoin is currently only accepted by few online merchants. Many companies don’t also recognize bitcoin as a legitimate exchange, making it an unfeasible investment vessel. Besides, there’s only a fixed supply of bitcoin — 21 million.Wallets can be lost. If your hard drive crashes or virus corrupts your wallet file, you lose your bitcoins. You can go from a wealthy to bankrupt investor within seconds with no way to recover.",
        "Conclusion: Is it still worth investing in Bitcoin",
        "Many people have been watching Bitcoin for years and wondering if it is still worth it and how to invest in bitcoin wisely. There are many expert opinions all over the internet trying to persuade people in both directions, whether it’s to buy and hold (or “hodl”) or to short it via CFDs.",
        "The important thing is to do your own research and understand the risks. While many famous people on the internet may tell you different stories, smart investors always advise to never risk more money than you can afford to lose."

Investing assumes holding a financial asset for profit purposes for a substantial time. It could be some financial assets that allow investors to get regular payments, like dividends, from it. There are a variety of investment instruments available to ordinary people nowadays.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Only three decades ago, the world of investments belonged to a higher caste of people. The trading process of financial entities was implemented by qualified traders only at special places like Wall Street, London Stock Exchange etc. With the development of the internet, financial markets became accessible to the general public. This proliferation can be ambiguous in the sense that the trading opportunity itself is a good thing. However, the level of traders’ expertise became relatively low. There is a spectrum of traders on one trading platform, from complete amateurs to high-level pros coexisting with each other. And the latter are outnumbered, as you may understand. This lack of knowledge can lead to false analysis conclusions and significant losses as a result.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">The Internet brought us not only trading opportunities. The last decade was a decade of digital currency. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin and thousands or maybe even hundreds of thousands of crypto coins, tokens, and NFTs emerged from nowhere. Some are complete scams, and some are born to vanish in oblivion. But there are definitely names worth our attention for the investing prospects.</span></p><div class=\"q-box qu-mx--n_medium\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"><div class=\"CssComponent-sc-1oskqb9-0 QTextImage___StyledCssComponent-sc-1yi3aau-0  cfUEeh\"><div class=\"q-box unzoomed\" tabindex=\"-1\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em;\"><img class=\"q-image qu-display--block\" src=\"https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-2f76ce99cc1af189d4620cd8f9b44263-lq\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></div></div></div><p class=\"q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Bitcoin and its investing capacity.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Cryptocurrency as an investment asset is very young compared to others, so its predictive potential is still unstable. From an investing point of view, Bitcoin is not a great instrument; it is too volatile. Also, the reason that limits the investments in Bitcoin is that the Bitcoin network has no scalability to it. It’s not going to expand into something bigger than just the Bitcoin transaction network.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">For instance, if we take XRP, it is a coin of the Ripple payment network accepted by more than 100 financial institutions worldwide.

It could be some financial assets that allow investors to get regular payments, like dividends, from it. There are a variety of investment instruments available to ordinary people nowadays. Only three decades ago, the world of investments belonged to a higher caste of people. The trading process of financial entities was implemented by qualified traders only at special places like Wall Street, London Stock Exchange etc. With the development of the internet, financial markets became accessible to the general public. This proliferation can be ambiguous in the sense that the trading opportunity itself is a good thing. However, the level of traders’ expertise became relatively low. There is a spectrum of traders on one trading platform, from complete amateurs to high-level pros coexisting with each other. And the latter are outnumbered, as you may understand. This lack of knowledge can lead to false analysis conclusions and significant losses as a result. The Internet brought us not only trading opportunities.

Cryptocurrency as an investment asset is very young compared to others, so its predictive potential is still unstable. From an investing point of view, Bitcoin is not a great instrument; it is too volatile. Also, the reason that limits the investments in Bitcoin is that the Bitcoin network has no scalability to it. It’s not going to expand into something bigger than just the Bitcoin transaction network. For instance, if we take XRP, it is a coin of the Ripple payment network accepted by more than 100 financial institutions worldwide. Among them are: * Santander; * SBI Remit; * Credit Agricole; * Siam Commercial Bank; * SEB etc. Some say Bitcoin has a potential to be an alternative currency for the US economy in the future. Maybe, if we talk about decades, it is possible. Through all these decades, Bitcoin will rise and fall so many times. This is not very valuable for us as investors. For now, we need to establish what is the best strategy for dealing with Bitcoin. It can hardly be viewed as an investing tool, but it can be viable as a long-term trading instrument. There will be a possibility to buy it in the near future at the lowest price in the prospect that it will grow to the all-time highs of November of 2021at the very least.

Ultimately it is up to you to decide whether any investment is in your own best interest.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">The trading value of Bitcoin has been going up like a rocket.  At the time I am writing this the value on Mt Gox is about $29 / coin.  A couple of weeks ago it was closer to $0.40 / coin.  That is a promising trend; but it also means that the value of Bitcoin is volatile right now.  Bitcoin is very new and is based on a new concept, which makes it difficult to know how to accurately assess its value.  So it is hard to tell if Bitcoin is really worth what people are paying for it.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Bitcoin is also traded in relatively low volume - at least compared to more established currencies - which will probably make its value more sensitive to moment-to-moment market fluctuations.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">One thing that I can say with certainty is that the rapid growth in value that we are seeing now will not continue forever.  Hopefully the value of a coin will stabilize at some point.  It is hard to tell if it actually will stabilize - Bitcoin could crash and become worthless instead; or its value could fluctuate for a long time.  If it does stabilize it is also hard to tell whether the stable value will be higher or lower than it is now.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">An encouraging feature of Bitcoin for a potential investor is that it has built-in deflation.  By design, new coins are being mined at a diminishing rate.  There will only ever be a little over 20 million coins in circulation.  Almost all of those coins will be in circulation by 2033 (see the Wikipedia article, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin).  So if Bitcoin does become stable, as the world economy grows and the number of coins on the market does not, the value of Bitcoin should gradually increase over time.  If that does happen that would make Bitcoin a pretty safe long-term investment.

There are other people who know more about mining than I do; so I will address the question of buying Bitcoin as an investment. Disclaimer: I am not an economist or a financial adviser.  I am a programmer.  Ultimately it is up to you to decide whether any investment is in your own best interest. The trading value of Bitcoin has been going up like a rocket.  At the time I am writing this the value on Mt Gox is about $29 / coin.  A couple of weeks ago it was closer to $0.40 / coin.  That is a promising trend; but it also means that the value of Bitcoin is volatile right now.  Bitcoin is very new and is based on a new concept, which makes it difficult to know how to accurately assess its value.  So it is hard to tell if Bitcoin is really worth what people are paying for it. Bitcoin is also traded in relatively low volume - at least compared to more established currencies - which will probably make its value more sensitive to moment-to-moment market fluctuations. One thing that I can say with certainty is that the rapid growth in value that we are seeing now will not continue forever.  Hopefully the value of a coin will stabilize at some point.  It is hard to tell if it actually will stabilize - Bitcoin could crash and become worthless instead; or its value could fluctuate for a long time.  If it does stabilize it is also hard to tell whether the stable value will be higher or lower than it is now. An encouraging feature of Bitcoin for a potential investor is that it has built-in deflation.  By design, new coins are being mined at a diminishing rate.  There will only ever be a little over 20 million coins in circulation.  Almost all of those coins will be in circulation by 2033 (see the Wikipedia article, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin).  So if Bitcoin does become stable, as the world economy grows and the number of coins on the market does not, the value of Bitcoin should gradually increase over time.  If that does happen that would make Bitcoin a pretty safe long-term investment.  But a lot of things will have to fall into place before we are at that point.

There are some people who hate me for it. I’m getting quite a few people all asking me the same question: “Is it too late to invest in bitcoin?” I don’t think it is. Bitcoin is a paradigm shift in a world that is high on worthless currency printed in excess. The only way to fund our excessive lifestyles is to increase the global debt and pay for it with money printed out of thin air. My approach to bitcoin is different. It’s a little less drastic. I’ve been playing with it for years and have become fascinated by it. The rewards for me understanding bitcoin are now over 17,900%+ on the initial investment. I don’t think I’ve ever made another investment like it. It’s likely I will never make another investment like it for the rest of my life. There may never be another investment like it. The unfortunate psychological challenge when you buy something that performs beyond your wildest dreams is you think to yourself, “I should have bought more.” You can always want more and spend more. But it doesn’t matter. Money has never made me happy. The same is likely true for you. So how do you manage your psychology when bitcoin mania is sweeping the world and it has gone mainstream? How do you cope when it’s trending on twitter, on the front page of every newspaper, being promoted by some of the biggest wall street tycoons in the world, like Paul Tudor Jones? First, you stay calm. You’re never late to anything in life. You’re right on time. What bitcoin has done to date is irrelevant.

But in year 2020, it broke that resistance level and shot upto $40,000 which was hit recently. Instant 100% rise in less than 3 months.So should you invest in Bitcoin? Bitcoin rise of $0.1 to $40,000 did not happen so easily. If you are worried that you missed one of the insane bull run, bubble whatever. Don’t be worried, even people with balls of steel can’t see their investment going down 90%.

        "The favorite Crypto currency of most of the people is Bitcoin, which moved from $0.1 to $40,000 in just ten years. That’s 41362300% which is more than 4 crores % returns, insane ! But let’s analyze last ten years historical data of Bitcoin and check what it takes to Invest in Bitcoin.",
        "Between Sept 2010 to June 2011, Bitcoin raised from $0.1 to $30, that’s 29900% returns in less than one year. That’s the first bull move witnessed in Bitcoin. But just right after that, it crashed back to $2 from $30, that’s 93.3% crash. First crash! Can you Imagine losing more than 90%? That’s the volatility of Bitcoin.",
        "Every crash is followed by big bull run. Same happened with Bitcoin during 2011 to 2013. Moving from $2 to $240 in less than 2 years, that’s 11900% returns. Just after that, it crashed 80%, from $240, it went down to $50 in few months.",
        "Next spectacular move from $50 to $1250, this happened at a very short span of time, April 2013 to Dec 2013. In 8 months, 2400% returns. Remember this the period where BITCOIN gained huge traction, volumes increased higher. But right after hitting $1000 mark, Bitcoin crashed to $100, more than 90% crash in less than 3 months and continued to trade in a range.",

        "If one were to buy 2,000 Bitcoin just 7 years ago (2010), when the price per coin was $0.05, it would have costed them US$100. Today they would be worth +US$9,000,000.",
        "That being said, the risk of losing US$100 is justified if the potential gain is +US$9,000,000 (with the lottery being the only exception since you cant do any due diligence and, therefore, it is based purely on luck).",
        "The same logic holds true today. If the price per coin were to exceed US$100K, then today's prices will seem insignificant. US$100K per coin is doable considering the fact that Block chain works, more institutions are accepting Bitcoin, there will be a limited number of coins which will curb supply (thus price will have to increase in order to satisfy demand), and Bitcoins historical track record has proven that it can in fact sustain gains of that magnitude. Although many people would say, “this is highly unlikely due to regulatory roadblocks” id bet those same people were saying the same thing when Bitcoin was at US$0.05. Now its at US$4,700.",
        "So, is it wise to invest in Bitcoin today?",
        "I dont think it is wise to throw every dollar you have at it, but i think it would be justified for it to be <1% of your portfolio. It is a hugely speculative move, and is mostly from a FOMO (fear of missing out) standpoint but, in my opinion, the risk of losing <1% is worth the potential gains since the upside could be HUGE.",
        "On another note, while on the cryptocurrecny topic:",
        "Id also recommend looking at Etheruem.",
        "What bitcoin did for money and payments via Block chain, Ethereum may do for applications of all shapes and sizes. That is interesting because it is a much broader application of the underlying technology. Price per Ether token (currency that runs on the Ethereum platform) will drastically increase as the popularity of the decentralized Block chain-based Ethereum platform continues to rise.",

        "Bitcoin’s and other cryptocurrency fluctuations have been on the headlines recently and there are many discussions on whether investing in them is worth the ink it’s written on in 2019.",
        "The unprecedented rise on cryptocurrency has seen the introduction of regulations that are taking shape. Introducing regulations reduces uncertainty to give a significant boost to trading activities and coin prices. Tighter regulations are helping to tackle crypto scams that hitherto reduced investment desirability; new coins and investments have certain criteria to adhere to. The presence of regulations has helped to calm the fears of potential investors and offering a better foundation for future investments.",

As the biggest revolution since the advent of the Internet, Bitcoin represents an outstanding opportunity for entrepreneurs and investors (Bitcoin with capital B means the bitcoin Blockchain - whereas bitcoin with “b” refers to the eponymous digital currency). However, unlike the Internet, opportunities for Bitcoin investors go beyond buying companies’ equities: investors can also buy \"shares\" of the overall Bitcoin emerging industry itself - by simply purchasing bitcoins. In that case, the bitcoin currency becomes a valuable asset - as it acts as an index of the Bitcoin industry as a whole. The bitcoin currency can also be considered as a valuable asset for another reason: bitcoin has the potential to take over gold as the ultimate sound money or store of value (although this won't happen overnight, but may not be that distant). I understand this may be shocking news to some people as it implies a drastic paradigm shift from the gold's 6000-year bubble. But History proved that new paradigms and resulting ecosystems can be adopted quickly. Like gold, bitcoins are: . Scarce - since only 21 million bitcoins will eventually be issued by 2140; . Fungible; . Impossible to counterfeit - as the security of Bitcoin has proved to be unbreakable since its inception in 2009 - although Bitcoin has been receiving more attacks than any other information systems in History. However, compared to gold, bitcoins - being electronic data - are far much easier and cheaper to: · Verify - as bitcoins are stored on an online public ledger, the Blockchain - and anyone can check their existence by freely accessing the Blockchain through the Internet; actual ownership of bitcoins can also be established remotely without the involvement of a third party or disclosing any confidential information; · Store and transfer - since the costs to transfer and store bitcoins are insignificant - especially when considering using bitcoin as a store of value; · Divide - For the same low transaction fee, Bitcoin can automatically handle even the tiniest transfers of value (the smallest unit of bitcoin, also known as Satoshi, being worth 100 000 000 of a bitcoin). Last, gold is as difficult to protect as it is easy to confiscate; on the contrary, bitcoins: · Can be conveniently protected (although, for the time being, that does not come without a few challenges I might talk about in future posts), · Are impossible to confiscate - since bitcoins can be spent only by their owners; furthermore, bitcoins are redundantly stored on thousands of computers disseminated all over the world; even if most of such computers were seized or damaged, bitcoins will still be accessible by their owners via a simple Internet connection. Current market cap of all the gold available in the world is around 7 trillion dollars. If, in the coming years, bitcoin, as a store of value, were to grab just 10% of the gold's market cap, the price of one bitcoin would be around $ 50 000! And that value does not even take into account: . The superiority of using bitcoins when it comes to retail payment, forex, international remittance, the inclusion of the unbanked, or as a replacement for defective currencies (i.e. most of the currencies of the underdeveloped world - to say the least); . The applications that may use the Bitcoin Blockchain to store, safeguard, and transfer any ownership titles (stocks, deeds, digital keys...), or to execute smart contracts - without the intervention of a central entity.",

Getting rich overnight is a risky endeavor if the only goal is to become wealthy. Not every investment opportunity is a sure bet. Also, if you put a lot of money into an investment that doesn't pan out, that could end up being a costly mistake.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Conversely, if you're interested in buying crypto because you believe it has long-term potential, then it doesn't matter when you buy.

Secondly, you can ensure that your portfolio contains a well-diversified collection of strong stocks. Your overall portfolio will remain strong if your crypto investments fail to do well.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Investing money you can afford to lose is also critical. The hard part about investing your entire life savings in cryptocurrency is that it means you will most likely lose it all, but putting a small amount of money into the market that has little impact on your finances will reduce your risk.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Regardless of whether or not you decide to invest in cryptocurrency, it also depends on your investment strategy. Buying now might be a good investment if you can afford it and are able to tolerate high-risk investments. However, there are many other investment opportunities if cryptocurrency isn't for you.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Bitcoin's inherent risks</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Risk is inherent in all investments, and no matter how hard you try, you cannot get around it.

The price of equities is known to fluctuate, but Bitcoin has seen even more extreme price movements.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">However, there are other risks with Bitcoin as well. It's impossible to predict whether or not this currency will catch on. If this does not happen, demand for the product is likely to decrease. Should Bitcoin demand decrease, the price will fall as well.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">As well, there is no guarantee what kinds of regulatory issues may arise with regard to digital currencies such as Bitcoin.

Conversely, if you're interested in buying crypto because you believe it has long-term potential, then it doesn't matter when you buy. A smart long-term investing strategy involves buying only if you plan to hold on to your investments for several years. The system that provides the greatest and most consistent growth for the longest time (AWARDED) One can't be wrong when there are over 23,172 Telegram followers. Due to your long-term investment strategy, buying today, a month from now, or six months from there will not be a huge difference for you. This means that if Bitcoin has an ultimate value of $500,000 per token, whether you purchased it at $35,000 or $40,000 per token won't matter. You could still earn a lot of money no matter what happens to crypto. Do you believe in cryptocurrency? Cryptocurrency can be a high-risk investment because nobody knows whether it will succeed in the long term. Therefore, if you are a risk-averse investor, you should not consider investing in cryptocurrencies. There are various safeguards you can put in place when acquiring cryptocurrency, though. Secondly, you can ensure that your portfolio contains a well-diversified collection of strong stocks. Your overall portfolio will remain strong if your crypto investments fail to do well. Investing money you can afford to lose is also critical. The hard part about investing your entire life savings in cryptocurrency is that it means you will most likely lose it all, but putting a small amount of money into the market that has little impact on your finances will reduce your risk. Regardless of whether or not you decide to invest in cryptocurrency, it also depends on your investment strategy. Buying now might be a good investment if you can afford it and are able to tolerate high-risk investments. However, there are many other investment opportunities if cryptocurrency isn't for you. Bitcoin's inherent risks Risk is inherent in all investments, and no matter how hard you try, you cannot get around it. However, when you purchase a digital currency like Bitcoin, you're taking on more risk than you would if you put your money into a quality stock. For one thing, while Bitcoin may have been around for a lot less time than many of the companies that trade on the stock market today, it has been around for a lot less time than a lot of other digital currencies. The price of equities is known to fluctuate, but Bitcoin has seen even more extreme price movements. However, there are other risks with Bitcoin as well. It's impossible to predict whether or not this currency will catch on. If this does not happen, demand for the product is likely to decrease. Should Bitcoin demand decrease, the price will fall as well. As well, there is no guarantee what kinds of regulatory issues may arise with regard to digital currencies such as Bitcoin. Until additional clarity is provided, this is a high-risk proposition. Investing in Bitcoin isn't necessarily a poor decision because of the risk involved. Is it a good retirement investment? I highly doubt it. No one can know if Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will be part of the global financial system for another decade or more. A lot of people assume that if they are a decade or more away from retirement, it can be very unsettling. When buying Bitcoin, it is therefore important to follow a few basic rules: Make sure you invest only a moderate amount of your money in it. You should be prepared for the possibility that your investment will be lost. This can be intended to be used for a short period of time only Investing in stocks should be done on a long-term basis, as the market has a history of rewarding investors who persevere. Cryptocurrency markets do not have any kind of historic precedent. Bitcoin could turn out to be a moneymaking opportunity for you. If that turns out to be your own personal experience, you should take your profits and invest them in a portfolio that will support you in retirement. But, don't hold your breath waiting for an investment in Bitcoin to pay your long-term senior living expenses.",

Even though Ethereum is very slow, many Layer-2s are being built on-top of it that improve its speed and transaction volume.

      "content": "WHAT IS BITCOIN Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies that only exist digitally, do not rely on any central bank or authority or server, and through cryptography mask transactions. Since it was published as open source software in 2009, Bitcoin has probably been enjoying the greatest popularity of reputation among them. Bitcoin transactions are registered on a blockchain, an online ledger which is open to the public. Each block in a blockchain is generated when a transaction is validated by someone called a \"miner\" bitcoin, who gets the bitcoin after a programme finishes some math problems (getting into the nitty gritty of blockchain is an essay within itself, but this is the gist of it). Bitcoin's anonymity is one of the reasons they're a big hit with a large variety of people — especially those who want to keep their transactions secret out of principle, and, more recently, those who want to get on board the virtual gravy train before it's too late. Before Beginning There are many things that any aspiring investor needs at Bitcoin. The normal specifications are a digital wallet, personal identity papers, a safe Internet connexion, a payment system and an account at a cryptocurrency exchange. True payment forms that use this route include bank accounts, debit cards and credit cards. Bitcoin can also be purchased at specialist ATMs and via P2P exchanges. Be aware however that Bitcoin ATMs in early 2020 were increasingly requiring government-issued IDs.  Additional information about buying bitcoin are available that we won't cover here.

Below are some of the biggest risks I see facing bitcoin as it pertains to become a widely adopted currency. </span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\"></span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">a.

The government’s position on bitcoin is not clear. But it does seem plausible that the government could make it illegal, as the currency is somewhat competitive to government. The government could also try to regulate it and/or tax it the way it does other industries. <br>Depending on the specifics of the regulation, it could potentially make it less attractive to own bitcoin.   </span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\"></span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">b.

If you could use bitcoin for any purchase the way you can use existing currency, it would be more practical to own. If you can’t spend the bitcoin, you would still need to own some other currency. </span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Lack of adoption is a risk, however more and more consumers and merchants are buying, using and selling bitcoin, all around the world. Bitcoin has a “network effect.” Just as more of your friends start using facebook, you are more likely to start using Facebook, and as more and more of your life and personal data are stored on Facebook you are less likely to stop using Facebook. </span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\"></span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">c.

The date range is November 1st 2013, to May 25th 2014. As you can see, the price has been quite volatile. An important risk factor for the future of Bitcoin is whether it will can achieve a stable value. Stable prices are an important quality of a successful currency. If prices are too volatile, it becomes risk to own the currency, accept it as a form of payment, etc. </span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\"></span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">d.

Liquidity is characterized by a high level of trading activity. Assets that can be easily bought or sold are known as liquid assets.”</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">If an asset is “liquid,” it means it is easy to convert it into cash quickly. For example, large market cap stocks often have very high trading volumes, so you can find a buyer or seller pretty quickly. Conversely, if an asset is “illiquid,” it is hard to convert it to cash quickly. For example, a house is fairly illiquid. It can take months to find a buyer for a house. </span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Liquid assets are more attractive than illiquid assets, all else being equal. Bitcoin has yet to be widely adopted or traded by the general population. However, bitcoin exchanges aggregate supply and demand and make it easier to convert between bitcoin and cash. </span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\"></span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">e.

      "content": "It is my personal opinion that bitcoin has a small chance of becoming priced significantly higher than it is today. While the chance is small, the upside is high enough that It's worth making the investment as part of a diversified strategy.  This is similar to betting on a startup. Because I believe the chance is so small, I would not want to have a significant portion of my wealth in bitcoin. I would invest only a small percentage of my wealth in bitcoin. I would not try to buy and sell it like a day trader. Because of bitcoin’s price volatility, I would not want to take that risk. Instead, I would buy it and hold it as a long term investment.  Opportunity  If bitcoin was widely used as a currency it would most likely be priced significantly higher than it is today. It would likely be priced higher because it could only be widely used as a currency if a lot of people bought it first. The increase in demand for bitcoin would cause the price to rise.   Risks  Bitcoin is still a relatively new technology and there are a lot of potential risks associated with investing in it. Below are some of the biggest risks I see facing bitcoin as it pertains to become a widely adopted currency.   a. Government Regulation  If the government were to make it illegal to own or use bitcoin, it would likely deter people from doing so. The government’s position on bitcoin is not clear. But it does seem plausible that the government could make it illegal, as the currency is somewhat competitive to government. The government could also try to regulate it and/or tax it the way it does other industries. Depending on the specifics of the regulation, it could potentially make it less attractive to own bitcoin.     b. Limited Adoption  If there are very few people who accept payment in the form of bitcoin, there would be less incentive to own bitcoin. If you could use bitcoin for any purchase the way you can use existing currency, it would be more practical to own. If you can’t spend the bitcoin, you would still need to own some other currency.  Lack of adoption is a risk, however more and more consumers and merchants are buying, using and selling bitcoin, all around the world. Bitcoin has a “network effect.” Just as more of your friends start using facebook, you are more likely to start using Facebook, and as more and more of your life and personal data are stored on Facebook you are less likely to stop using Facebook.   c. Volatility  The above chart was sourced from  Bitcoin News, Prices, Charts, Guides & Analysis - CoinDesk [ http://coindesk.com/ ] . The date range is November 1st 2013, to May 25th 2014. As you can see, the price has been quite volatile. An important risk factor for the future of Bitcoin is whether it will can achieve a stable value. Stable prices are an important quality of a successful currency. If prices are too volatile, it becomes risk to own the currency, accept it as a form of payment, etc.   d. Lack of Liquidity   According to Investopedia, liquidity is “The degree to which an asset or security can be bought or sold in the market without affecting the asset's price. Liquidity is characterized by a high level of trading activity. Assets that can be easily bought or sold are known as liquid assets.” If an asset is “liquid,” it means it is easy to convert it into cash quickly. For example, large market cap stocks often have very high trading volumes, so you can find a buyer or seller pretty quickly. Conversely, if an asset is “illiquid,” it is hard to convert it to cash quickly. For example, a house is fairly illiquid. It can take months to find a buyer for a house.  Liquid assets are more attractive than illiquid assets, all else being equal. Bitcoin has yet to be widely adopted or traded by the general population. However, bitcoin exchanges aggregate supply and demand and make it easier to convert between bitcoin and cash.   e. Safety of Supporting Services/Products  There are a plethora of products and services that make traditional currency more usable. There are banks (for storage and lending), credit card companies, wallets (for portability), payment processors, etc. Similar products and services are needed and offered to make bitcoin more usable.   Mt. Gox recently declared bankruptcy and it led to a lot of public criticism over bitcoin as a viable currency.  However, more and more companies are starting to support the bitcoin ecosystem. As new firms enter the market, competition forces out the unsafe companies and enables the safe companies to survive and grow.    d. Competition  Other cryptocurrencies could erode bitcoin’s market share. More currencies in the market means more competition, and capital spread accordingly. Reaching “critical mass” could be quite productive for bitcoin. Competing currencies make it more difficult to do so. There are many other digital currencies or cryptocurrencies, and new ones are being created regularly. The last chapter of this book contains a brief list of some of them.   Is bitcoin too expensive at current prices?   The fact that many people are asking if bitcoin is a bubble, or believe that is, is an indication that it's not a bubble. An en economic bubble is usually coupled with near universal belief about rising prices. Housing circa the early 2000s and  higher education [ http://www.amazon.com/Popping-Higher-Education-Bubble-Impending-ebook/dp/B00JLUSUN4 ]  in 2014 provide illustrations of near universal beliefs.  There are still only a very limited number of people who even know what bitcoin is, let alone are buying it or believe it's price will keep rising. I don’t think we are anywhere near universal belief that the price of bitcoin will continue to rise.  Bitcoin still only has minuscule value as compared to global currency. If bitcoin were to replace a larger percentage of global currency it would be worth much more than it's worth now. If it were to replace global currency...I can't even guess how much it would be worth.  I agree that it only has value because people think it has value...but the US dollar only has value because people think it has value too. Same with gold. Same with antiques.

        "A number of large and small retailers accept the cryptocurrency as a form of payment, although reports suggest that demand for this function is not high. If fewer people begin to accept Bitcoin as a currency, these digital units may lose value and could become worthless.The improvement in domestic payment methods and the rapid development of alternative (non-cryptocurrency) forms of international transfers, however, has reduced bitcoin’s advantage in this area, especially given its increasing fees and frequent network bottlenecks.Bitcoin’s cost and speed advantages are being eroded as traditional channels improve and the network’s fees continue to increase and availability remains a problem in many countries.Security risk:If a thief gains access to a Bitcoin owner's computer hard drive and steals his private encryption key, he could transfer the stolen Bitcoins to another account.This is particularly problematic once you remember that all Bitcoin transactions are permanent and irreversible. It's like dealing with cash. There is no third party or a payment processor, as in the case of a debit or credit card – hence, no source of protection or appeal if there is a problem.Market risk:Like with any investment, Bitcoin values can fluctuate. Indeed, the value of the currency has seen wild swings in price over its short existence.Regulatory risk:Furthermore, the increasing oversight and regulation to prevent money laundering and illegal transactions have restricted the cryptocurrency’s use for privacy reasons.",
        "Conclusion:Money you put in banks or FDs is used to give loans.Money you put in the stock market helps the economy grow.The only use of Bitcoin is as an alternate currency. Which implies, that for it to become actually useful, all fiat currencies including the US Dollar, the Indian Rupee etc. will have to fall. I am not sure if that is practically possible.",
        "Way too many people have made serious money from Bitcoin. And many many more probably will.But it is impossible to tell till then this will last. Might last beyond our lifetimes, or might last 2 more years.",
        "I suggest you put a little money in it that you won’t regret losing. It might make you rich. Or it might go down the drain. That is the only way to deal with risky investments."

        "However, by 2021, the concept of investing in Bitcoin will have become more mainstream, thanks to the efforts of people like Michael Saylor and Elon Musk, who are encouraging others to do so. It may be a very different asset from what investors are used to seeing, but it also provides a lot more than conventional assets."

Gox, once the largest bitcoin exchange on the planet, recently declared bankruptcy and disappeared with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin.<br>Government interference is a serious threat to bitcoin. China recently outlawed financial institutions from making bitcoin related transactions. Although governments can’t directly take down bitcoin, they can make it illegal and harder to use.<br>It is not legal tender.

Gox, Silk Road Black Market, and falling prices, the progress being made is undeniable. More money than ever is being pumped into the bitcoin ecosphere and it is hard to think that is going to disappear any time soon. Still, disappearing is an option.

Still he says that he hasn’t felt the way he feels about bitcoin since he first started getting involved with the internet. He is calling it “the Internet in 1993, 1994.” On the other hand well known economist Paul Krugman calls bitcoin “evil” and doesn't believe it has the necessary characteristics of money to succeed. (It is worth noting that Krugman thought the internet was a fad and would never become anything special) </span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 0px; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">It is clear the the jury is still out on bitcoin. One of the most important things to know when investing in Bitcoin is that your entire investment could disappear. “It is either going to become this global currency, this global store of value, this global remittance platform, this global payment system, this global money transfer network, or it’s not,” says SecondMarket’s CEO Barry Silbert. It is an extremely high-risk high-reward investment. It is possible that its value could continue to go up exponentially as it has in the past, or it could go to zero. I agree with many other investors that say the potential reward far outweighs the risk. However, do not invest what you cannot afford to lose.</span></p>",

This is a huge plus for people that live in countries such as Argentina and Zimbabwe where their government’s overzealous printing of money has devalued their currencies.The bitcoin protocol cannot be manipulated by any single entity. There is no person or group of people that can change the way bitcoin operates. Think of it as a bank that is run by non-discriminatory and infallible math instead of people. Entities such as paypal and various banks have been known to block transactions to certain people or groups that they deem unfit. With bitcoin you can give money to whoever you want, wherever they are, whenever you want. \tIt is just as important to understand the disadvantages of bitcoin before making an investment decision. So what are its drawbacks? Bitcoin’s price volatility has made it a somewhat unstable store of value. Bitcoin’s value has been known to play chutes and ladders. It can gain or lose value of more than 20% in a day. A merchant might sell one of their products for 1 bitcoin on Monday and that bitcoin might be worth 20% less by Wednesday.Exchanges have been known to be sketchy and fraudulent. Mt. Gox, once the largest bitcoin exchange on the planet, recently declared bankruptcy and disappeared with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin.Government interference is a serious threat to bitcoin. China recently outlawed financial institutions from making bitcoin related transactions. Although governments can’t directly take down bitcoin, they can make it illegal and harder to use.It is not legal tender. Nobody is required to accept bitcoins and it value is purely determined by its users. There is no central bank or government backing it. These are the biggest advantages and disadvantages to bitcoin. After taking these into consideration it is important to look at the current bitcoin economic climate. After recent negative announcements from China, the price is hovering in the 450 range, far from its all time high of 1200. At the same time there are many positive developments taking place every day.  Li-Kashing, Asia’s riches man, recently made a high profile investment in Bit-Pay, one of the largest Bitcoin payment processors that was recently valued at $160 million New companies such as Overstock and Shopify are beginning to integrate bitcoin. $500,000 dollars worth of bitcoin is being given out to MIT students so they can learn how to use it and develop new applications for it.Second Market is slated to create a publicly traded bitcoin fund that will give ordinary investors an opportunity to invest in bitcoin.Coinbase, a bitcoin wallet and brokerage service, recently announce the creation of its one millionth consumer bitcoin wallet. \tAlthough the public opinion of bitcoin can be slighted by recent stories about Mt. Gox, Silk Road Black Market, and falling prices, the progress being made is undeniable. More money than ever is being pumped into the bitcoin ecosphere and it is hard to think that is going to disappear any time soon. Still, disappearing is an option. Many believe bitcoin’s future success to be binary. Either is is going to fail or it is going to be a wildly popular and successful currency of the future.  \tProponents such as Marc Andressen, the billionaire developer of the first commonly used web browser and co-founder of Netscape, has been an early investor in Twitter, Pinterest and Facebook. Still he says that he hasn’t felt the way he feels about bitcoin since he first started getting involved with the internet. He is calling it “the Internet in 1993, 1994.” On the other hand well known economist Paul Krugman calls bitcoin “evil” and doesn't believe it has the necessary characteristics of money to succeed. (It is worth noting that Krugman thought the internet was a fad and would never become anything special)  It is clear the the jury is still out on bitcoin. One of the most important things to know when investing in Bitcoin is that your entire investment could disappear. “It is either going to become this global currency, this global store of value, this global remittance platform, this global payment system, this global money transfer network, or it’s not,” says SecondMarket’s CEO Barry Silbert. It is an extremely high-risk high-reward investment. It is possible that its value could continue to go up exponentially as it has in the past, or it could go to zero. I agree with many other investors that say the potential reward far outweighs the risk. However, do not invest what you cannot afford to lose.",

        "I first discovered bitcoin while browsing reddit a few years ago during the June of 2011 bubble. At the time a single bitcoin’s market value was a record $30 and the currency’s users were ecstatic. For whatever reason I passed it off as a fad and the following days of the price falling only reassured me that it was. Fast forward a couple years to early 2013 and another bitcoin article pops up on reddit. Bitcoin had set a new all time high and was still on the rise. The new decentralized crypto-currency caught my interest again and this time I seriously considered investing. After doing some research I became infatuated with bitcoin. This was not just because it has the potential to increase my personal wealth but because the technology has the potential to change the world. As bitcoin is still in its early stages, the price isn't as important as the protocol itself and the work being put into making it more valuable.",
        "As with any investment, it is important to understand what you are investing in before you put money into it. This is what makes bitcoin so tricky. Its technological complexities are understood by few outside of the computer science world. It is for this reason that Warren Buffet wont touch it with a ten foot pole- he simply doesn't understand it. In the same way that most people do not understand how the internet works, most people do not understand how bitcoin works.This lack of understanding scares off many new potential investors and is a major impediment to bitcoin’s growth. However those who dig deeper into what bitcoin is can gain a solid understanding of its features after reading a few short articles. Only once you know how bitcoin and its ecosystem works can you do a thorough advantage-disadvantage analysis and determine whether or not it is better than its competitor, fiat currency.",
        "So what are the advantages of bitcoin?",
        "As a mean of exchange, bitcoin is far superior to other currencies.  Bitcoin can be transferred between any two people on the planet with internet access for a very small fee or no fee at all. Because there is no centralized third party needed to verify transactions, there is no need to pay for something such as a wiring fee or credit card fee. For the first time in history somebody can transfer massive amounts of monetary value across the world for free. The global and frictionless nature of bitcoin also allows underbanked people living in developing countries to access a global bitcoin economy. In a world where more people have internet connected telephones than toilets, bitcoin can serve as a revolutionary facilitator of global commerce and trade. Bitcoins are very secure. A well secured bitcoin wallet is much harder to break into than a bank. Bitcoin also beats out credit cards on this front as when you make a bitcoin transaction you don't give the merchant the information needed to charge you extra. When Target was hacked, millions of credit card numbers were stolen and subject to fraud. This could not happen with bitcoin.Bitcoin transactions are very transparent. Although you might not know who is sending who money, the block chain provides a public ledger of every bitcoin transaction that has ever taken place. This allows regulators to track any illicit activity in a way that is not possible with cash.Because there is a finite supply of bitcoin, the rate of inflation is predetermined and easily trackable.

The common sense tells us that we shouldn’t put all eggs in one basket, so bitcoin — and other cryptocurrencies for that matter — is one of the baskets to think about, and it is arguably the most potent basket to anyone’s portfolio. Let’s look at a few reasons why that’s the case. Now, How to buy Bitcoins? You can Buy Bitcoin using CEX.io which is a great place to BUY/SELL bitcoin (Supports any debit/credit card, Bank Transfer etc. ) To Buy Bitcoin using Paypal you may choose, LocalBitcoins which is super fast, Peer-to-peer bitcoin trading website. But to secure your money and bitcoin just verify your mobile, turn on two factor authentication via Google Authenticator APP and you can buy Bitcoins within an hour. It has escrow service so rest assured your money is safe.) 1. Bitcoin has a solid tech foundation It is decentralized, backed by the rock-solid blockchain technology. You can can’t just invent more bitcoins — its protocol is set to automatically half the volume of bitcoins that can be mined every four years. So while there will be new bitcoins on the market, there won’t be a ton of them, making sure that the law of supply and demand keeps ticking to the benefit of bitcoin owners. 2. Bitcoin has been around since 2009 It is not invented yesterday, and we had almost a decade to play with it. The underlying technology (blockchain) has proven its worth and is now used by major corporations. So there is value behind bitcoin, and again — other cryptocurrencies. Speaking of which, the newer cryptocurrencies are also made on solid foundations though they tend to be more volatile than bitcoin. 3. Bitcoin is the digital gold standard As noted, Bitcoin is the longest running cryptocurrency and is considered the digital gold standard. This in turn makes it a safe haven when economic challenges struck; for instance, bitcoin was up 15 percent on the news of Brexit. And with general economic uncertainty, its role as a safe haven will become increasingly important. 4.

Think about digital currencies like viewing your checking account balance online — you see the number on your screen, but you don’t have the bills in your hands. In the case of Bitcoin and other digital currencies, however, there is no standardized physical representation (like a dollar bill) — the assets exist only in digital form. There's also no regulation. The payment network that allows the digital tokens to move between individuals isn’t managed by any one entity (like the government) or company (like Visa, Wells Fargo or Venmo). Instead, it’s decentralized, made possible by a system of computers around the world. You can't use it for many purchases. Some large retailers like Overstock and Expedia have made headlines by starting to accept it, but they're outliers.

For example, think about when you send someone an email — you retain the original, and they receive a copy. If the same thing happened when you sent money, it’d be a real problem, says Tilleman. That’s why we currently rely on intermediaries — banks, credit unions, companies like PayPal — to make sure that doubling-up issue never occurs. These middlemen charge fees for ensuring that when you send someone money, you’re parting ways with it completely, and the other person is legitimately receiving it. With Bitcoin, there's also always an intermediary — it's whoever is managing the transaction, whether an exchange or other platform. But because there are no restrictions on who can participate (and no account minimums), they're not the traditional financial services players.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">SHOULD YOU INVEST IN BITCOIN?</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Before diving into Bitcoin or other digital currencies, you need to understand the risks. One: volatility.

If you decide to go forward, dollar-cost averaging could be a good way to do it, since each prices vary widely from day to day. (How? Take the amount of money you decided to put in, then divide it by 12. On the first of every month for a year, buy that amount of your chosen currency.) Two top digital currencies are currently Bitcoin and Ethereum, so Ong says he’d likely look at those first, putting 70 to 80 percent of his portfolio in those two coins, then invest the remaining 20 to 30 percent in smaller cryptocurrencies.

You create an account, input the account information you’d like to use, then make your purchase. Know that if you do use an exchange, just like transferring to any currency, you will be charged a transaction fee — for example, Coinbase’s averages 1.49 percent for Bitcoin, says Dan Romero, vice president and general manager of Coinbase.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Since Bitcoin isn’t controlled by any one entity, if your coins are stolen by a hacker, they’re likely gone forever.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Finally, let's talk about security risk here — and the extra steps you need to take to keep your assets safe.

You can read the fine print on an exchange’s security policy to see if they offer insurance, but that’s rare — most insurance companies shy away from insuring digital currencies since it’s almost impossible to retrieve stolen coins. Instead, look into using a “hardware wallet” like Ledger or Trezor, says Ong. These cost less than $100 and are protected with a PIN and a backup called a \"seed\" in case you forget your PIN.

        "If you’re looking for an easy way to buy Bitcoin or another digital currency, there are user-friendly exchange services that allow you to use money in your bank account to make the purchase. “Coinbase is kind of the gold standard, but there are a lot of other really great exchanges that offer a wider range of currencies,” says Tilleman. You create an account, input the account information you’d like to use, then make your purchase. Know that if you do use an exchange, just like transferring to any currency, you will be charged a transaction fee — for example, Coinbase’s averages 1.49 percent for Bitcoin, says Dan Romero, vice president and general manager of Coinbase.",
        "Since Bitcoin isn’t controlled by any one entity, if your coins are stolen by a hacker, they’re likely gone forever.",
        "Finally, let's talk about security risk here — and the extra steps you need to take to keep your assets safe. When you buy stocks, a registry is kept of all the shareholders. But since Bitcoin isn’t controlled by any one entity, if your coins are stolen by a hacker, they’re likely gone forever. “Whoever has it owns it,” says Ong.",
        "Once you buy units of a digital currency, they’re kept in your digital wallet, which can be easily stored on the exchange you purchased it on. The site gives you a unique key (a string of letters and numbers) to use for access. But keeping your Bitcoin in the exchange-provided digital wallet might not be the most secure option — for example, in late January, hackers stole upwards of $500 million in digital currency when they broke into an exchange called Coincheck. You can read the fine print on an exchange’s security policy to see if they offer insurance, but that’s rare — most insurance companies shy away from insuring digital currencies since it’s almost impossible to retrieve stolen coins. Instead, look into using a “hardware wallet” like Ledger or Trezor, says Ong. These cost less than $100 and are protected with a PIN and a backup called a \"seed\" in case you forget your PIN. Suffice it to say you'll have to make sure you keep this device as safe as possible. Ironically, the best place to do that might be an old fashioned safety deposit box at old fashioned institution called a bank."

I've been doing a fair amount of research on blockchain so I feel comfortable discussing it's merits and use for the future. I do not like your reference to the dot com bubble. How is the \"dot com\" bubble doing? It's dream was to change everything. I don't think anyone could make a valid argument that it hasn't. Of course there were losers along the way. There always is with new technologies. But in the long term the technology has been proven and is growing even more into our lives. There are patchy start ups and pyramid scheme'ish looking companies being introduced for an example check out bitconnect. These \"quick buck\" companies will without a doubt come crashing down if they don't act with integrity. But in what world are there no losers when a new technology comes into play?

With Lightning Network, you will be able to send bitcoin at virtually no cost. In fact, the cost are so low that the Lightning Network engineers had to develop a new way to account for the costs (bitcoin only goes to 8 decimal places, and fees could be as little as .000000000000001 bitcoin). This will make bitcoin very easy to transact with, and simple for anybody to create their own payment solutions using bitcoin as a free (or almost-free) payment network.

Many will fail—possibly bitcoin may fail, too—but the ones that succeed will solve a problems so big that even if they’re modestly successful, their value will skyrocket. To get into the crypto market, you need to buy bitcoin. Therefore, as more people get interested in the crypto market, they’ll buy bitcoin, and the price will go up.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Also look at your overall investment strategy.

      "content": "I’ll answer this question from a slightly different perspective, purely from an investment perspective. Then I’ll address some points others have made because. If you’re only interested in making money, your decision is simple. From today until the day you plan to sell bitcoin, do you think the price will rise more quickly than any other thing you can buy? If so, then invest in bitcoin. If not, buy something else. So, will the price of bitcoin rise more quickly than other things you can buy? Yes. Here’s why:Bitcoin developers have released the Lightning Network. With Lightning Network, you will be able to send bitcoin at virtually no cost. In fact, the cost are so low that the Lightning Network engineers had to develop a new way to account for the costs (bitcoin only goes to 8 decimal places, and fees could be as little as .000000000000001 bitcoin). This will make bitcoin very easy to transact with, and simple for anybody to create their own payment solutions using bitcoin as a free (or almost-free) payment network. In fact, Bakkt has stated this is one of its objectives, and Starbucks invested in the platform for that very reason. Once merchants realize they can eliminate the 1–3% fees and costs of $.09 per transaction by switching from Square or Visa or PayPal to a bitcoin-backed payment system, they will. And the demand for bitcoin will skyrocket, along with bitcoin’s price.There are many projects and lots of development going on to improve bitcoin. These projects aim to lower costs, increase speed, enable more transactions per second, and better regulate the market. These improvements will make bitcoin more valuable, which will probably lead to people being willing to pay more for it.Large investors and investment firms are quietly buying bitcoin. I’ve written about this in other answers, with evidence, as have other writers. It’s an open secret. In the past, when large investors have moved quietly into an investment, they soon market the investment heavily—promotions, ads, “training,” etc. And as a result, people buy it.Financial institutions are making it easy for people to buy bitcoin as part of their traditional investment accounts. TD Ameritrade and Robinhood have already done this for individual investors, Goldman Sachs and Coinbase are doing this for institutional investors, and both Bank of America and JP Morgan have said publicly that there’s a lot of demand for these “safe” ways to buy crypto. If they’re right, you’re going to see a lot of money move into this space in the coming years (maybe months).You also need to consider the cryptocurrency market as a whole. You have a $200 billion market chasing $200 trillion to $1 quadrillion worth of value. Anything of value can be stored on a blockchain, with a cryptocurrency the only way to extract value from it. While it’s impossible to predict which cryptocurrencies will see the biggest increase from today’s price, cryptocurrencies as a whole have no place to go but up (long term). Many will fail—possibly bitcoin may fail, too—but the ones that succeed will solve a problems so big that even if they’re modestly successful, their value will skyrocket. To get into the crypto market, you need to buy bitcoin. Therefore, as more people get interested in the crypto market, they’ll buy bitcoin, and the price will go up. Also look at your overall investment strategy. You should always own some “non-correlated assets” that sometimes boom. Bitcoin is a non-correlated asset—its price moves independently from other asset classes (i.e., real estate, bonds, stocks, etc). Putting a small portion of your total wealth in these assets will give you a low-risk way to boost the performance of your overall investment portfolio. If the price goes to the moon, you can sell your bitcoin for cash. If the price craps out, you lose very little. Learn About Why Asset Correlation Matters. I also believe that the tax and regulatory situation around cryptocurrencies will change over the next few years. In the US, at least a certain amount of cryptocurrency spending will not be subject to capital gains or losses. I also think there’s an outside chance the US will legislate sweeping regulatory reform regarding crypto, like we did for the Internet in the early 90s. Too many rich, powerful interests stand to make too much money and they don’t want the government to screw this up for them.

In the past, when large investors have moved quietly into an investment, they soon market the investment heavily—promotions, ads, “training,” etc. And as a result, people buy it.Financial institutions are making it easy for people to buy bitcoin as part of their traditional investment accounts. TD Ameritrade and Robinhood have already done this for individual investors, Goldman Sachs and Coinbase are doing this for institutional investors, and both Bank of America and JP Morgan have said publicly that there’s a lot of demand for these “safe” ways to buy crypto. If they’re right, you’re going to see a lot of money move into this space in the coming years (maybe months).",
        "You also need to consider the cryptocurrency market as a whole. You have a $200 billion market chasing $200 trillion to $1 quadrillion worth of value. Anything of value can be stored on a blockchain, with a cryptocurrency the only way to extract value from it. While it’s impossible to predict which cryptocurrencies will see the biggest increase from today’s price, cryptocurrencies as a whole have no place to go but up (long term). Many will fail—possibly bitcoin may fail, too—but the ones that succeed will solve a problems so big that even if they’re modestly successful, their value will skyrocket. To get into the crypto market, you need to buy bitcoin. Therefore, as more people get interested in the crypto market, they’ll buy bitcoin, and the price will go up.",
        "Also look at your overall investment strategy. You should always own some “non-correlated assets” that sometimes boom. Bitcoin is a non-correlated asset—its price moves independently from other asset classes (i.e., real estate, bonds, stocks, etc). Putting a small portion of your total wealth in these assets will give you a low-risk way to boost the performance of your overall investment portfolio. If the price goes to the moon, you can sell your bitcoin for cash. If the price craps out, you lose very little. Learn About Why Asset Correlation Matters.",
        "I also believe that the tax and regulatory situation around cryptocurrencies will change over the next few years. In the US, at least a certain amount of cryptocurrency spending will not be subject to capital gains or losses. I also think there’s an outside chance the US will legislate sweeping regulatory reform regarding crypto, like we did for the Internet in the early 90s. Too many rich, powerful interests stand to make too much money and they don’t want the government to screw this up for them. Can you imagine buying an asset today knowing you might be able to use it tax-free in a few years?",
        "For more of my perspective, read these other answers I’ve written:",

        "Regarding other Quora comments:",
        "“The only reason to buy bitcoin is to sell it to somebody else for more than you bought it for.”",
        "This is not true.",
        "You can also bitcoin for its intended purpose—sending money to anybody, anywhere, in any amount, anytime, instantly and with certainty that you will receive exactly what you ask for without giving out sensitive personal information, bribing anybody, or risking theft while your wealth changes hands. There is no other way to send money that way.",
        "That’s the intrinsic value of bitcoin. How much is that worth? The markets will decide. You have no control over that.",
        "I suggest you buy a little bitcoin—use the Abra wallet on your phone, not an exchange. With Abra, you have full control over your bitcoin. Then use it. Understand how it works. You will feel more comfortable with your decision whether to invest or not. You will also have perspective that most of the world does not have.",
        "If you only buy and sell bitcoin and never use it, you will never understand the convenience, security, and cost-savings of sending money directly to other people without needing a bank account or cash—you will simply wonder why anybody would want to own a bunch of numbers on a screen. Just like if you only buy and sell stocks and never hold them in your portfolio, you will never understand the satisfaction of collecting dividends and owning a share of a business—you will simply wonder why anybody would give up real money in exchange for an IOU from a corporation that could fail or go bankrupt. Just like if you only buy and sell theater tickets and never watch a show, you will never understand the power of emotional and intellectual stimulation—you will simply wonder why anybody would spend $50 or more to spend 2 hours sitting in darkness watching other people pretend to do things. You will see only price, not value. Maybe you’ll decide to invest in bitcoin, stocks, and theaters, or maybe you won’t—but you’ll make that decision based on your own thoughts and observations, not the movement of lines on a price chart or Quora answers.",
        "“Bitcoin’s bubble burst.”",
        "This might be true but I doubt it.",
        "Look at this classic “anatomy of a bubble” chart:",
        "Some people think that chart shows 2017’s “boom” — but it doesn’t. We haven’t reached true boom, just the first sell off. Only 2–8 percent of people own cryptocurrency, depending on what survey you believe. More people own fidget spinners. 2–8 percent is not a craze, it’s just media hype.",
        "Perspective: the price of bitcoin has had many extreme upswings and declines. In fact, this is the norm for all cryptocurrency—up 1,000% then down 67% then up 1,000% then down 67% is just the way the prices move. See for yourself:",
        "Bitcoin (BTC) price, charts, market cap, and other metrics | CoinMarketCap",
        "Many cryptocurrencies are more valuable now than before the so-called bubble. In fact, bitcoin’s price is up 25% compared to this time last year, 600% compared to this time in 2016. The speed and intensity of bitcoin’s price action is simply insane, but just because something’s volatile doesn’t make it a bubble and just because it goes down doesn’t mean it’s dead.",
        "There are many projects and lots of development going on to improve the cryptocurrencies in general. These projects aim to lower costs, increase speed, enable more transactions per second, and better regulate the market. Bakkt, alt-coin breakthroughs, IBM/XLM combo, blockchain-enabled secondary markets, blockchain-enabled financial and social networks, crypto businesses, cryptocurrency custodians, other advancements in blockchain technology…I could go on! Bitcoin will benefit because, as stated above, everybody needs to buy bitcoin to get into the crypto space.",
        "“Bitcoin is too expensive to be useful.”",
        "This is relative. Two points to be made.",
        "First, businesses pay a lot of money to send and receive money. They pass these costs on to you, the customer. you never see them, but the business owners do. It costs between 1–3% plus $.09 per transaction, on average, to handle electronic payments. MoneyGram charges you to send money overseas (up to 15%). Your bank charges you to wire money (mine charges $15). Amazon does not charge you to use a credit card—instead, Amazon covers the costs and doesn’t even tell you about it. But somebody always pays.",
        "Bitcoin eliminates those costs, but passes the burden onto the sender instead of the business. As I write, it costs about 20 cents USD to send bitcoin from my Abra wallet. With Lightning Network, it costs less than one-thousandth of a cent USD. With a Bakkt- or Coinbase-based payment solution, it may end up being totally free.",
        "Second, it’s less expensive to buy and sell bitcoin than other types of assets. Bitcoin wallet providers will charge 1–2 percent to convert your cash into bitcoin, which is in line with retail stockbrokers and comparable to online brokers on average ($7 fee for a $700 purchase of stock is no unusual). It costs a lot less than real estate (5–10% total costs) or gold (2–3% commission plus transportation fees).",
        "Also, there’s no minimum or maximum amount you can buy or sell, you have lots of people/businesses who can get you into the market for free, and it costs nothing to store."

LOL dogecoin isn't even a real cryptocurrency, I mean it's a joke based off real cryptocurrency. it can be infinitely reproduced so it has actually no value but if people buy it up faster than its mine, then its value increases. elon musk knows this so he bought a lot of dogecoin, values goes up and then sell, repeat the cycle and make profit now it. these were stocks this would be incredibly illegal and get musk in deep trouble but coins aren't protected again they're decentralized so market manipulation is super easy",
        "With time I learned that, you don't matter shit to society, they only care whether you have money or not, you can be completely evil, but provided you have money, society will blindly follow you, and they'll think you're doing whatever good for the world. The world only cares about money and the power it holds, society has only one reason to make something popular, whether it makes money or not. They don't care whether the good is useful or not, or if it is harmful to its users, they only care whether you can make money with it.",
        "you clearly cannot make money with fediverse or XMPP, heck even with real decentralization. You cannot because there's no boss, there's no master. Only us trying to make the internet actually free and private for all. And as we are making services for the greater good of people rather than for profit, we are not making any money with this.",
        "It's true that some people have made money, a lot of money with cryptocurrency but for all the stories of people who made a lot of money, the stories you don't hear about are people who have lost a lot of money.",
        "people that want to make money will place the idea, the concept in cloud 9, because they need this, they need you, and they need you to be used in an awful way. You'll have random people screaming at you about how great this is, because they want you to be the one that pools money in and loses.",
        "you'll eventually realize the utopian ideals of this stuff is so unrealistic and how its based off a fallacy. It's all about speculation. it's about making money without really making anything.",
        "Yes maybe you can make the illusion of money with that fake centralization Blockchain proposes, it is a fake decentralization because, if someone, for example, bans you, it's recorded in the blockchain that you're banned, so you can't do shit, you can't say \"alright, I'll create a new account\" which is not different from getting banned from Twitter and creating a new account. So it's still the same, in real decentralization, if you get banned, you just create an account in other server and that's it (Or you can create your own server!). With blockchain this is not possible, you'd have to create your own blockchain, which will be separated from the blockchain you were using before, it's like going from Twitter to something like Gab.",
        "and please shut the gag about the whole but, bitcoin is decentralized, its not sweetie, its not. None of the cryptocurrencies are truly decentralized. They’re actually centrally controlled by the miners, who can basically rewrite history at will. They made people believe that what they're using it's actually decentralized, but in practice, it's exactly as centralized as Twitter and similar.",
        "It doesn't help that there is an industry built around promoting this. If you see somebody online talking about making a lot of money in cryptocurrency, it's safe to assume they don't know how to do it because if they did, they would be spending their time and resources with cryptocurrency instead of trying to sell some PONZI scheme on the Internet.",
        "People don't realize that the market for cryptocurrency is controlled by the people who have a lot of it. These people are referred to as “WHALES.” If somebody wants to liquidate a large quantity of bitcoins, because the market is relatively small, it will depress the price to the point where equilibrium is eventually reached. The fate of the market is directed by the big players.",
        "Bitcoin blocks take forever to compute. Literally, a transaction takes 10 minutes to an hour to compute and verify! And it’s not getting better, it’s getting worse because BitCoin was set up to have increasingly difficult mine operations. cryptocurrency's value is derived from nothing it's unlocked through meaningless computations that don't have any correlation with work or any basis beyond creating",
        "But why would people change to blockchain despite the fact it's exactly the same shit? many have said once cryptocurrency stabilizes then it can be used as a proper means of transactions like it won't be jumping around this much, but SURPIRSE SURPRISE, that may never happen since it would require equivalent of trillions of us dollars spent by people using just a single cryptocurrency on actual goods not speculative markets and that can't happen you know unless it's already stable because businesses won't accept a speculative coin. it won't be used for trading because it's not stable and it won't be stable because it's not used for trading.",
        "it's exactly the same shit. When they banned Trump from Twitter and shit, people started thinking \"Alright, centralization is bad, we need decentralization\". So, instead of going for the real decentralization (XMPP, Fediverse...) They went for the shit \"decentralization\", Projects like bitcoin, solana, ethereum, Litecoin, Monero, Veil and Harmony and God knows what else.",
        "And again, why did they choose the shit decentralization instead of the real decentralization? Because with Blockchain and shit, you can make money, you can't with the other kind of decentralization. But something even better is that CEOs can keep their users happy while having the same control over users, because, again, it's one blockchain per network, if you're banned from one blockchain, you have to go to another or join the same blockchain again.",
        "Go ahead, sheeples, follow the herd. Crypto will never be real money."

        "So let's say you have $100k to invest, you put 60% in stocks (diversified portfolio or S&P index), 20% in bonds 10% in cash and 10% in some high risk investment like Bitcoin. So you have to be comfortable, with losing that 10%. Maybe for you 5% or even 1% would be a better allocation. Bitcoin has shown that it can go down up and down in value rapidly. So you should be prepared and totally cool with that before investing. No one wants to lose money, but think of it as part of an overall investment strategy.",
        "Also, if you do buy some bitcoins, be sure to spend some as well. This will help the bitcoin economy and ultimately increase the value of Bitcoin. So consider part of your investment as \"spending money\" to help aid the economy."
