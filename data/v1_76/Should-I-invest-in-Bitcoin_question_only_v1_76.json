Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency and I would say that to successfully earn off cryptocurrency, it’s all about timing, studying the market if you decide to self trade, but luckily for me, I use Cryptoblock Invest and this platform manages all possible risks with their various Trading and Hodling programs. CBI got me covered everytime and you can use the google search engine “Cryptoblockinvest” to get more info about the platform. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"

      "content": "Let’s start with what bitcoin is? Bitcoin is a digital currency created in January 2009 following the housing market crash. It follows the ideas set out in a whitepaper by the mysterious and pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto. The identity of the person or persons who created the technology is still a mystery. Bitcoin offers the promise of lower transaction fees than traditional online payment mechanisms and is operated by a decentralized authority, unlike government-issued currencies. There are no physical bitcoins, only balances kept on a public ledger that everyone has transparent access to, that – along with all Bitcoin transactions – is verified by a massive amount of computing power. Bitcoins are not issued or backed by any banks or governments, nor are individual bitcoins valuable as a commodity. Despite it not being legal tender, Bitcoin charts high on popularity, and has triggered the launch of hundreds of other virtual currencies collectively referred to as Ripple. Etc. Bitcoin is powered by a technology called a blockchain. To understand Bitcoin, you must understand a little bit about the technology in order to make a wise choice for your investment strategy. A blockchain is a public database that shows all transactions, with user privacy protected by “cryptography”. There are many types of blockchains, and many types of coins. Since Bitcoin was created, there have been hundreds of more coins brought to the market, many of which are cheaper, faster, and more efficient. For example, Litecoin processes at 56 transactions per second. Newer faster blockchains like EOS can process hundreds of thousands of transactions per second. In terms of utility, Bitcoin only processes 7 transactions per second. So you may be wondering, why is the price of Bitcoin so high? There are lots of reasons, such as the fact that it was the first coin, it has brand recognition, and you can use to buy services on some internet websites. But other coins like Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash are catching up. Why Invest in Bitcoin? It seems silly to some people that one bitcoin can be worth thousands of dollars. What makes bitcoins valuable? Bitcoins Are Scarce Let’s look to gold as an example currency. There is a limited amount of gold on earth. As new gold is mined, there is always less and less gold left and it becomes harder and more expensive to find and mine. For this reason, along with Gold’s millenia-long history as a medium of exchange, it has long been considered a hedge against monetary inflation. “Gold is a very under-owned asset, even though gold has become much more popular. If you ask any central bank, any sovereign wealth fund, any individual what percentage of their portfolio is in gold..., you'll find it to be a very small.... It's...imprudently small..., particularly at a time when we're losing a currency regime.” Ray Dalio, Legendary Hedge Fund Manager The same is true with Bitcoin. There will only be 21 million Bitcoins, and as time goes on, they become harder and harder to mine. Take a look at Bitcoin’s inflation rate and supply rate: and harder to mine. Take a look at Bitcoin’s inflation rate and supply rate: Bitcoins Are Useful In addition to being scarce, bitcoins are useful. Bitcoin provides sound and predictable monetary policy that can be verified by anyone. Bitcoin’s monetary policy is one of its most important features. It’s possible to see when new bitcoins are created, when a transaction is created, or how many bitcoins are in circulation. Bitcoins can be sent from anywhere in the world to anywhere else in the world. No bank can block payments or close your account. Bitcoin is censorship resistant money. Bitcoin makes cross border payments possible, and also provides an easy way for people to escape failed government monetary policy. The internet made information global and easy to access. A sound, global currency like Bitcoin will have the same impact on finance and the global economy. If you understand the potential impact of Bitcoin, it won’t be hard to understand why investing in bitcoin may be a good idea. Bitcoin’s Price There is no official Bitcoin price. Bitcoin’s price is set by whatever people are willing to pay. Buy Bitcoin Worldwide’s is a good resource for the current and historical price. Bitcoin’s price is generally shown as the cost of one bitcoin. However, exchanges will let you buy any amount, and you can buy less than one bitcoin. Lower inflation risk. Unlike world currencies — which are regulated by their governments — bitcoin is immune to inflation. The blockchain system is infinite and there’s no need to worry about your cryptos losing their value. New opportunities. Bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading is relatively young — new coins are becoming mainstream on a daily basis. This newness brings unpredictable swings in price and volatility, which may create opportunities for massive gains. Minimalistic trading. Stock trading requires you to hold a certificate or license. You must also go through a broker to trade a company’s shares. But bitcoin trading is minimalistic: simply buy or sell bitcoin from exchanges and place them in your wallet. Bitcoin transactions are also instant — unlike the settlement of stock trading orders, which could take days or weeks. Disadvantages of Bitcoin Investments Bitcoin may be the future of monetary exchange, but it is equally important that you are aware of the concerns surrounding cryptocurrency investing. Here are some serious risks associated with bitcoin investments.Volatility. The price of bitcoin is always rippling back and forth. If you happened to buy bitcoin on December 17, 2017, the price was $20,000. Weeks later, you couldn’t sell your investment for more than $7,051. The bitcoin market is constantly changing. With such an unpredictable market, you can hardly get a good return on your investment. To avoid huge loss, keep a close eye on the market.Threat of online hacking. Hacking is a big threat facing a bitcoin investor. Bitcoin exchanges let you buy and sell your cryptos using a mobile app or website. This leaves them susceptible to hacking and theft of all your investment. And bitcoin held on exchanges isn’t insured by the FDIC.Little or no regulation. The bitcoin market currently operates with no major regulations. It isn’t taxed and governments have no clear stance on it. As a result, you could stand exposed to fraud and malpractice.Limited use. Bitcoin is currently only accepted by few online merchants. Many companies don’t also recognize bitcoin as a legitimate exchange, making it an unfeasible investment vessel. Besides, there’s only a fixed supply of bitcoin — 21 million.Wallets can be lost. If your hard drive crashes or virus corrupts your wallet file, you lose your bitcoins. You can go from a wealthy to bankrupt investor within seconds with no way to recover.Conclusion: Is it still worth investing in Bitcoin Many people have been watching Bitcoin for years and wondering if it is still worth it and how to invest in bitcoin wisely. There are many expert opinions all over the internet trying to persuade people in both directions, whether it’s to buy and hold (or “hodl”) or to short it via CFDs.

This proliferation can be ambiguous in the sense that the trading opportunity itself is a good thing. However, the level of traders’ expertise became relatively low. There is a spectrum of traders on one trading platform, from complete amateurs to high-level pros coexisting with each other. And the latter are outnumbered, as you may understand. This lack of knowledge can lead to false analysis conclusions and significant losses as a result. The Internet brought us not only trading opportunities. The last decade was a decade of digital currency. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin and thousands or maybe even hundreds of thousands of crypto coins, tokens, and NFTs emerged from nowhere. Some are complete scams, and some are born to vanish in oblivion. But there are definitely names worth our attention for the investing prospects.Bitcoin and its investing capacity. Cryptocurrency as an investment asset is very young compared to others, so its predictive potential is still unstable. From an investing point of view, Bitcoin is not a great instrument; it is too volatile. Also, the reason that limits the investments in Bitcoin is that the Bitcoin network has no scalability to it. It’s not going to expand into something bigger than just the Bitcoin transaction network. For instance, if we take XRP, it is a coin of the Ripple payment network accepted by more than 100 financial institutions worldwide. Among them are: * Santander; * SBI Remit; * Credit Agricole; * Siam Commercial Bank; * SEB etc. Some say Bitcoin has a potential to be an alternative currency for the US economy in the future. Maybe, if we talk about decades, it is possible. Through all these decades, Bitcoin will rise and fall so many times. This is not very valuable for us as investors. For now, we need to establish what is the best strategy for dealing with Bitcoin. It can hardly be viewed as an investing tool, but it can be viable as a long-term trading instrument. There will be a possibility to buy it in the near future at the lowest price in the prospect that it will grow to the all-time highs of November of 2021at the very least. The thing is that every four years, so-called Bitcoin halving happening. What is this? Basically, it’s the control mechanism of cryptocurrency inflation by reducing the number of coins in the system. When you reduce the amount of some assets, it creates scarcity. Scarcity makes prices of this asset go up. Something like this will happen in the period of the upcoming two years. Next, Bitcoin halving is planned to occur in March of 2024. By that time, the current Bitcoin bearish market will end. We can expect the rise of Bitcoin and all the cryptocurrencies along with it. It’s no secret that literally all crypto coins and tokens, major or minor, are heavily correlated with Bitcoin price. According to the previous halvings price range, we can predict that the next Bitcoin halving will be followed by a Bitcoin take-off to the $100,000 price tag. This strategy is not an investment in the broad sense. Trading assumes buying at the lows and selling at the highs. The next Bitcoin 4 year cycle will also consist of two indispensable parts: bullish and bearish. When the bullish part will come to an end Bitcoin assets should be sold.",

If bitcoin crashes and burns, I don’t care because I already made a lot of profit in the past. I have nothing to lose. Bitcoin is a very risky investment but also very profitable. My advice? Again, put 1% of your wealth in bitcoins. Even if you can only afford 2 bitcoins with 1% of your wealth, go for it. If bitcoin crashes, who cares? You still have 99% of your wealth. If it soars and goes to the moon then you will have something to talk about with your friends in a pub.",

But right after hitting $1000 mark, Bitcoin crashed to $100, more than 90% crash in less than 3 months and continued to trade in a range.",
        "It took more than 3 years for Bitcoin to cross its previous resistance level of $1000. But the moment that barrier was crossed, it instantly shot upto $20,000 in less than a year with intermittent small corrections of -15% to -30%. But after that? Yes, extreme volatility came in again.",
        "BTC came all the way down to $3000, crashed 85% from its peak level and it took 3 years to break the $20,000 barrier. But in year 2020, it broke that resistance level and shot upto $40,000 which was hit recently. Instant 100% rise in less than 3 months.",
        "So should you invest in Bitcoin?",
        "Bitcoin rise of $0.1 to $40,000 did not happen so easily. If you are worried that you missed one of the insane bull run, bubble whatever. Don’t be worried, even people with balls of steel can’t see their investment going down 90%. Invest in Bitcoin, only if you are okay to loss all.",
